# Hello there! I just started learning Java. I initially thought that Java was SUPER hard. 
However, it really isn't. I used this simple 12 hour tutorial on youtube to learn this

 Thank you Bro Code ðŸ¤œ

How "myJava.java" works:
There are different functions, and in each function, there is a different code that does not do the same thing as the code in the next function 

Currently, there are 5 functions that I have made:

â€¢ expressions();
â€¢ input();
â€¢ gui();
â€¢ binarySearch();
â€¢ math();

Uncomment the one you wanna run, and enjoy!!
